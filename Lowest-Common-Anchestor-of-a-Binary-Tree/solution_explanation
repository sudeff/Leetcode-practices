My idea was for p and q subsequently, add the ancestors in a different list.
Then find the first common element of lists.

Also we apply it by using subtrees

For example, the LCA of p and q will be the same as the LCA of the ancestor of p and q.

Or we can start from the root and go right and left, find the anchors of the two and try to go down as far as we can
