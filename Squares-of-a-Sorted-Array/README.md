Squares of a Sorted Array

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example:

Input: nums = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10] Output: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100]

Approach

Brute Force (Straightforward):

1. Square each element in the array.
2. Sort the resulting array.

Time & Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) (for the output array)
