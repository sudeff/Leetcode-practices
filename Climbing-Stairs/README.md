You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.  
Each time you can climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Approach :
- Recursive
- Dynamic Programming (Bottom up): Time O(n), Space O(1).
- Optimized Fibonacci: Since this is basically the nth Fibonacci number.
