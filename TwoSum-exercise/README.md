Two Sum

Problem Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to the target.
- You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you **may not use the same element twice**.
- Return the answer in **any order**.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]  # Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9

Time Complexity: O(n²)
Because we’re using a nested loop to check all pairs.

Space Complexity: O(1)
No extra space is used aside from basic variables.
